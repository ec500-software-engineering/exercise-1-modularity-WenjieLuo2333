## AI Module
### Name: AI Module

### Input:
Bo, bp, pul are three lists represent the value of blood oxygen, blood pressure and pulse which are defined as double.
bo, bp, pul: list [float value]
### Output:
Three double values for estimated health score

Data received from storage system is input to the unsupervised AI Module, and will generate the output which are three predicted values for patientsâ€™ future health condition estimation by using data as blood oxygen, blood pressure and pulse stored in storage system to make prediction.
