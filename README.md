It's a readme document for the architecture based on the design of Mohit.

## Simply run ```main.py``` to excute the process.<br/> And excute ```test.py``` to tun the test.
Threads are defined in ```Input_Thread.py```,```Process_Thread.py```,```UI_Thread.py```.<br/>
And the other modules are borrowed from team members(as the copyright).<br/>

## Input Module
copyright @Kainan Liu, edited by @Wenjie Luo<br/>
Input:<br/>
Bo, bp, pul are input from three txt files.<br/>
Output:<br/>
Three double lists<br/>

## Storage Module
copyright @Gang Wei<br/>
Input:<br/>
data from input module<br/>
Output:<br/>
Save all the data.<br/>


## Alert Module
copyright @Wenjie Luo<br/>
Input:<br/>
Get data from storage. format[float,int]<br/>
Output:<br/>
Alert Flag sent to UI Module<br/>


## AI Module
copyright @Xiang Li
Input:<br/>
Bo, bp, pul are three lists represent the value of blood oxygen, blood pressure and pulse which are defined as double.<br/>
bo, bp, pul: list [float value]<br/>
Output:<br/>
Three double values for estimated health score<br/>

Data received from storage system is input to the unsupervised AI Module, and will generate the output which are three predicted values for patientsâ€™ future health condition estimation by using data as blood oxygen, blood pressure and pulse stored in storage system to make prediction.
